DWTRNT – I believe everything is in DBO schema.
DRTRNT – We will be using BH, DBO, and ODS_EBS schemas.
BH holds the old Oracle R9 Billing history data.
DBO holds all of the current application tables including PeopleSoft.
ODS_EBS will hold the new R12 tables.

Some product code info in "Oracle PC mapping for 804180, 804120, 804190.xlsx"  41% PS codes

Kelly commented that we need to ensure that these distribution product codes are eliminated from the parts revenue in sales detail reports that she uses for balancing as well as the revenue inputs for standard warranty reserves (1st yr, 2-5 yr, concession, retrofit)

Can you please document this in the notes?

[‎12/‎10/‎2016 9:35 AM] Rosenbaum, Scott: 
okay, don't really need to talk. If you have a look at the Tavant Delivery page of the Report Testing spreadsheet it should make sense
Reports are listed in the left column, the IOB they are dependent on in next col.
Then I have the major work that needs to be completed in order to start testing those reports, with six base sets of work.
[‎12/‎10/‎2016 9:37 AM] Rosenbaum, Scott: 
Best I can tell, any report that only uses Sales data (e.g. DR tables - that are not linked to DW) does not need a change.
Just need to modify the environment to support Tavant
[‎12/‎10/‎2016 9:38 AM] Rosenbaum, Scott: 
Then we have the MAP_WARRANTY_EXPENSE_DATA table will be populated by data from Tavant, through a different program. Probably will be a push from Tavant using Informatica, and then build from stage tables.
Then we do the same for MAP_CONCESSION_EXPENSE_DATA
Then the Extended Warranty IOBs (must have no change), need to update 3 
[‎12/‎10/‎2016 9:40 AM] Rosenbaum, Scott: 
Then the PKG_030_EXT_WARR..  and then PKG_031_RETROFIT

[‎12/‎12/‎2016 8:34 AM] Rosenbaum, Scott: 
Morning Steve.
Priorities are: a) get the procedures running for Map_sales_data, Map_sales_data_68, Map_Concession_expense_data, and map_warranty_expense_data
[‎12/‎12/‎2016 8:35 AM] Rosenbaum, Scott: 
b) Solve any other incoming Pam issues.
c) Work on the R12 load script.
